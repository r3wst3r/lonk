Lonk provides MacOS, Linux and Windows implants which may lack the necessary evasive tradecraft provided by other more mature command and control frameworks.

A fork of postrequest's link, Lonk is r3wst3r's first pass at developing an adversarial C2 framework in the Rust programming language. A project goal is to be able to deploy from a kubernetes mesh using kris-nova's Aurae, currently in development, for no reason other than because it's neat.

## Features

Hopefully this list expands for humans to actually want to use this:

* HTTPS communication
* Process injection
* In-memory .NET assembly and Windows PE execution
* SharpCollection tools
* sRDI implementation for shellcode generation
* Windows link reloads DLLs from disk into current process

## Feedback

Feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/postrequest/link/issues/new).

## Build Process

- Clone or download the repo
- `cargo run` if you are eager to run it **right now**
- `cargo build --release` to build the link server executable
